# Case-Study-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Random-Forest
For this project weâ€™re supposed to own e-commerce store that sells books. We have sold thousands of books over the last year. And today we are going to use our transaction history to build a Fraud Detection System. One of the biggest problems is that anyone can steal a 15 or 16 digits credit card number along with security number and expiration date. Our task in this project is to tell apart the genuine transactions from fraud ones.
